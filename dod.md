DoD has not made it easy for startups/developers to work with them

Task Force Lima: generative AI task force

Department's position is that generative AI doesn't meet their ethical principles currently

AI must meet 5 principles, Gen AI can't meet them currently

Understanding risk
Improving human-machine teaming

Has to be reliable and traceable, must be confined to well-defined use cases, testable, governability

Has to be equitable (minimizing bias)

How does hardware and the DoD's closed network affect strategy?

Department sentiment is that it's a challenge to get the hardware they need for generative AI
 - some people say they need to be grabbing all the chips they can, others say advances in hardware make it manageable

What are we doing with LLMs? Building them, fine-tuning them, leveraging what's already out there?
